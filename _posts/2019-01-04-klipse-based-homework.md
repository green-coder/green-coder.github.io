(This live Clojure REPL is to be used by my daughter to complete her Clojure homework)

```eval-clojure
;; Modify this function so that it returns the
;; sum of the three parameters x, y and z.
(defn homework [x y z]
  (+ 2 2))

;; This should return 16, send me a screenshot once you're done.
(homework 5 7 4)
```

Once the homework is completed, the Nintendo Switch [may](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) spawn somewhere in the living room.
